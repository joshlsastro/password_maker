This is a password generator. It generates secure and memorable passwords in the style of [this website](http://correcthorsebatterystaple.net). It was inspired by [this xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/936).

### Prerequisites

You just need a way to run Python code.

### How to Run

Just run main.py in Python; it will prompt you for password parameters (it was tested with Python 3, but you should be fine with Python 2). If you don't want the interactive prompt, change the variables **above** the obvious line of #s.
