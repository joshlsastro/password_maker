This is a password generator. It generates secure and memorable passwords in the style of [this website](http://correcthorsebatterystaple.net). It was inspired by [this xkcd comic](http://xkcd.com/936).

### Prerequisites

You just need a way to run Python code.

### How to Run

Just run main.py in Python(it was tested with Python 3, but you should be fine with Python 2). If you need the password to be slightly different, change the variables **above** the obvious line of #s.
